# -Flower-Classification_using_Decision_Tree_Algorithm
Project Goal: The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify images of flowers into different species/varieties with high accuracy.  Data:  Flower image dataset with around 100-1000 labeled images of different flowers belonging to 10-20 categories. Each image would be labeled with the flower species/variety it belongs to.
